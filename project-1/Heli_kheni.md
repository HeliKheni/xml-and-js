Project Title: Software Company

Firstly we both (me and Hardi) discussed about the project title and reviewed softwarecompany.json file.
Then we decided how to convert this data into xml like which tags and subtags we will write.
Then Hardi converted whole file into xml and made the DTD.
Then I checked the xml and changed some names of tags.
Then she made DTD and I reviewd that.
Then she created the XSD file and I reviewed it and help her to solve her difficulties.
and I created the XSL file and then she review it.
Then again we both sat together and made html file of our project
and then we did the css of the same file also.
We both equally contributed and completed the project.
